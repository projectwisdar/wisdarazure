Deployment on Azure Websites
Deployment Process:

The Wisdar application will be deployed on Azure Websites for trial purposes, particularly targeting non-developers. We have set up an automated workflow to deploy the application directly from GitHub.
Each time changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, the deployment will automatically trigger, including managing migrations and other necessary tasks.
Accessing the Admin Panel:

After deployment, non-developers will be provided with a username and password to access the Django admin panel. The admin panel can be accessed at https://your-app-url.azurewebsites.net/admin/.
All administrative tasks, including content management, can be performed through this panel. We will handle migrations, user management, and other backend tasks during deployment.
Installed Applications
Django Admin: For managing the application content.
Django Allauth: For handling user registration, login, and social account integration.
Debug Toolbar: Enabled in development mode for debugging.
URL Configuration
The main URL patterns are defined in urls.py:

/admin/ for the admin panel.
/accounts/ for user authentication.
Root URL includes the main appâ€™s URLs.
Email Configuration
The application uses SMTP with Office365 for sending emails. Set up the following in settings.py:

python
#####
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.office365.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@outlook.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your-email@outlook.com'

Next Steps

This will ensure that the application is configured correctly for deployment on Azure Websites. Once that is done, we can proceed with any additional customizations or instructions you require.
